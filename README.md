# Moth Quest VI: The Mothening Overview
This is a school project showing off the skills i've aquired in the first eight weeks of foundations at DevMountain. The point of moth quest is to find criminally underappreciated moth babes, and elevate you yourself, as a moth.

# Features/Walkthrough
once all files have been downloaded, simply run nodemon and open up any of the HTML pages with a live server. from there, various flavor text exists, two moth babes can be found per location, and each babe can be, added, edited, and removed from the babe list, however, all eight babes are needed to become an alpha moth, and for the "Become Alpha" button to unlock, and complete moth quest VI. each moth and location was made by me myself with flavor text written by Shakespeare.
